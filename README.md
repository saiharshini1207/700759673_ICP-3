#Description for the numpy program

1. In this program first we import the numpy
2. Next we gonna construct a constructor by passing some parameters.
3. And we define the function "replace_maxmion" that takes a NumPy array, a replacement value, and an axis as input parameters and replaces the maximum value in each row of the array with the specified replacement value along the specified axis.
4. And now we initializes the main function by creating a random vector of size 20 as a floating numbers.
5. Now replacing the array shape from 4 to 5 and then by using "replace_maximum" we replace maximum value in each row with 0 along with axis 1.
6. Finally for the output original random vector, reshaped array, and the modified array are printed.
